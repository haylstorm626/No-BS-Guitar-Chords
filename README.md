# No BS Guitar Chords
A web app that allows a user to search for chords and returns a generated canvas drawing of the chosen chord. Can cycle through different shapes of each chord.

I just wanted an easy spot to look up chords and their many shapes without having to sift through advertisements and other BS...

## Usage
![Search Page](https://github.com/haylstorm626/no-bs-guitar-chords/blob/master/img/Capture1.PNG "Search Page")
![Search Page](https://github.com/haylstorm626/no-bs-guitar-chords/blob/master/img/Capture2.PNG "Search Page")

On the search page there's a responsive search bar to search for any chord. Clicking on one of the chords brings you to the chord page.

The chord displays with it's most common/basic shape. Below that are arrows that you may use to show other shapes of that chord.

## Project Status
The chord database is in progress. Currently it has the most common chords and some alternative shapes for them.

I may change some cosmetics. Maybe not. Half of the purpose of this project is simplicity after all.
